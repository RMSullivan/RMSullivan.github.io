I am a planner, I always have been.  It may have been art and music classes at a young age that taught me the importance of visualization and organization or just a way to cope with a learning disability.  No matter how it came about I am a planner, and that made HTML, CSS, and wireframes seem like second nature to me.  

HTML is the content of your site CSS the look and a wireframe is the plan of action you are going to carry out so you can tame the beast that is web development. Once I realized that organizing and nesting HTML was no different than organizing my day planner it was smooth sailing.  

Some tips that help me keep my HTML organized is to clearly nest and tag sections and not get div happy.  For example, a footer tag is not just the section at the bottom of your page that has the copyright info; it can also be the back to top link at the bottom of a blog post, or a related posts section on your page.  An aside can be a literal sidebar; it can also be supplemental information related to the primary content, a side note.  Tags are painted with broad strokes and using them to define what your code is doing will always make things easier.  Comments are vital, as organized as I think I am it doesn't mean someone else can read my mind or code, so comments that are substantive are always welcome. 

HTML is all around us; it has become the fabric of our lives, and by being organized and thoughtful it will become second nature to you.
