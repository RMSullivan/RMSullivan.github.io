I love lists, to do lists, shopping lists, I will always find a way to make a list for anything I have to do and coding is no different.  I find that coding in steps helps me keep everything organized and lets me work out bugs much easier.  I like to attack the harder stuff first and get it out of the way then at the end have some fun with the front end and "play".  


So how do I decide what is hard vs what is easy?  Well, first I do a wireframe of what I want to accomplish on the front end and make a list of the functionality of the program so I have a clear game plan.  Then I break it down into actionable steps.  Finally, I look at the list and decide what I least want to do and what I most want to do and I attack the "least items" first so as I progress I build up momentum and end the project with the most "fun" or interesting things.  

For me, I love doing front end so doing the wireframe in sketch.app lets me remember my end goal while I work on the back end and in the end have one cohesive application that stays true to my original plan.
