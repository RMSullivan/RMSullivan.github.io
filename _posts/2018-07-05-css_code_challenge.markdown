With all the new languages and concepts I am learning with Flatiron it has been really important to me to keep the languages I know fresh in my mind.  In order to keep the knowledge current, I created a code challenge.  This allows me to not only keep current knowledge fresh it also helps me add to my portfolio.  Right now I am having a fun time with wireframes and CSS animations.  Keeping my newly found HTML and CSS lessons sharp as I finish up Object-Oriented and move into SQL. Spending 1 hour a day on a past lesson is both helping me fill up my GitHub portfolio and keep the knowledge fresh.
