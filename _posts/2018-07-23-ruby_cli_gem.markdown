How do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time.  My Ruby CLI program scrapes realtor.com and returns a list of available rentals in a given zip code.  

I created my program in steps and as I progressed the program also changed.  My original plan was to create a program that scraped realtor.com for rentals in one preset zip code but as my confidence and understanding of what I could do grow, my program grew as well.

I created my program in parts and stitched them together, this allowed me to look at my program as small parts and made it less daunting. I broke down the project into the following small bites.

Step 1: I followed Avi's advise and wrote down a rough draft of the program and envisioned the code I would want in the future.  I created a list of immediate features and a list of what I would like the program to be in the future.  

Step 2:  Google, lots and lots of Google.  I found some great articles on Medium.com from Flat Iron Students along with some Youtube videos from students showing how their apps work.  This gave me some great inspiration for added functionality for my CLI app.  

Step 3:  Start with the toughest part first.  I wrote the core of my APP first, working out what I thought would be the hardest parts first.  

Step 4: Set up my local environment. Turns out the hardest part of the app was getting it to run.  I had my system preferences set to only run apps from the app store and I had several other programs that were causing issues.  I followed the instructions on the Flat Iron help page and set up a local environment. 

Step 5: Now that my local environment was set up it was time to work out the bugs.  I worked out the bugs from the core of my program.  I had made several changes, the biggest of which was that I discovered realtor.com uses the same URL for all the searches with the exception being the last 5 digits being the zip code.  This allowed me to expand my program to allow the user to enter any US zip code and then store it and input it into the URL.

Step 6: Now the fun begins.  I was most excited to work on the CLI interface and tie it into the scraping.  This was where I had fun, in a frustrated way, trying different things to get the code to work in the manner I had wanted.  

Step 7: Know when to quit.  The most important part of any project is delivering it.  I plan to continue tinkering with it but since it met the initial needs laid out in my assignment and it was due I stopped and delivered it.  It's so easy to get caught up in making something perfect but if you don't hand it over then it's useless.  

Step 8: Version 2, how can I make this better?
