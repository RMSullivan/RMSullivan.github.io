My family has a history of going back to school.  My Grandmother graduated with an A.S. in Sociology at the age of 67. All my aunts returned to school in their 40's.  My cousin is a nursing student in her 50's after a long career as a realtor.  Turning to education to change my life was not a stretch, in fact, it's the norm in my family.  So when I wanted a change, it was only natural that I would gravitate to schooling.  


One day I started googling my local community college's offerings and reading up on the different majors.  I thought about majoring in business, marketing, communications, social media marketing, teaching or brushing up on my graphic design skills to be more current.  I perused all the options, filled out paperwork for grants and scholarships.  When I first attended college over 20 years ago front end design was not an offering and reading into the graphic design program at my local college those were the classes that appealed to me.  I loved the idea of designing websites, but I also know myself, I would want to do the entire thing.  


The concept of designing, developing and maintaining sites brought me to the Web Developer program at my local college.  I also looked into boot camps, in my area, there are two well-known programs.   In the end, a 14-week  on campus boot camp that would require me to quit my job to complete it was not an option.  I was able to secure STEM grants and scholarships to pay for college, so I enrolled for the fall semester at my local college.  


I was nervous because I didn't have any real knowledge of what web development involved.  I got some subscriptions to magazines like Wired, watched Cheddar TV an online tech-based news channel and spent 1 hour a day reading Medium articles to learn as much as I could. My first semester went well.  I learned Python at school and picked up a few books on HTML and watched a few online tutorials to expand my knowledge.  My second semester was packed with languages.   I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and C++.  The downside was that this was taking forever.  I wanted to learn everything faster.  I decided to take a break during the summer semester and sign up for Flatiron School.  I hope to complete the Flat Iron program in the Fall, so I can begin the job hunt and make a better life for my family and me and ring in the New Year with a professional reset.
